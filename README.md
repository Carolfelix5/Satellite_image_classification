# Satellite Image Classification  

##  Overview  
This project classifies satellite images into four categories:
- **Cloudy**
- **Desert**
- **Green Area**
- **Water**

It utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras to analyze image features and achieve high classification accuracy.

##  Features  
✔ Preprocesses satellite images  
✔ Implements a CNN model for classification  
✔ Evaluates model performance with accuracy and confusion matrices  
✔ Uses data augmentation and train-test splitting  

##  Installation & Dependencies  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn scikit-image
```

## Model Performance
The model is evaluated using:

- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Visualization of classification results
